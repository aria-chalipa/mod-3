          <h2>chicken</h2>
          If you run your household in any way like mine, one of the words that comes to mind to describe it would probably be hectic, or something in that nature.  Everybody is running on different schedules, and lack of sleep, and structure can make it pretty stressful
          With everything that is going on in our busy lives, me and my lovely girlfriend never hesitate to sit down at the dinner table, and have a good meal at the end of it all.  When preparing a meal, I try to factor in the cost of the meal, making sure its healthy, and of course making sure it tastes good.  With that in mind we eat a lot of chicken.
          Chicken can be really simple to prepare, tends to be more lean compared to beef, and pork, but the challenge is finding different ways to prepare it, other than using Shake N Bake.  I have compiled 15 of my families favorite recipes on how to prepare a tasty, and healthy chicken dinner.
          This recipe has a delicious, unique flavor to it, if you are a fan of honey mustard.  You can even make it easier on yourself, and use straight up honey mustard, rather than combining the two separate items.  Although I recommend a Dijon Mustard, it is good either way.  Serve it up with some fries, and macaroni and cheese, and you have yourself a simple, yet delicious meal.
          Who doesn't love chicken nuggets?  I prefer these over the kinds in the bag any day.  They have more flavor, the chicken isn't processed, and they don't require too much time, or money.
